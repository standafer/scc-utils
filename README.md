# _UNOFFICIAL_ Solano Community College Student Utilities

Run `pnpm install` then `pnpm start` to start. Pnpm not required, though I haven't tested it with any other package manager. :)

Very minimally maintained. I attend a different Community College now, however, I still take Solano Community College classes from time to time, so I occasionally may fix breaking changes to the tool.
